# Flask and ReactJS

Web app using React.js to generate four (4) types of printable random objects and store them in a single file, each object is separated by a ",".  These are the 4 objects: alphabetical strings, real numbers, integers, alphanumerics.
Sample extracted output:

```
hisadfnnasd,126263,assfdgsga12348fas,13123.123, 
lizierdjfklaasf,123192u3kjwekhf,89181811238,122, 
nmarcysfa900jkifh,3.781,2.11,....
```

The output is 2MB in size. Once file generation is done the output is visible as a link which can be then downloaded by clicking on it. Also, there is a button on the page such that by clicking on this button the total number of each random object will be displayed.
